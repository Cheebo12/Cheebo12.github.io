title: Run To Fly 3D
---

RunToFly3D is a hyper-casual game for Android that combines the themes of runner and modifier. In this game, players control a character that can only move left or right while navigating obstacles such as arrows and birds that pop the character's balloons. By collecting balloons scattered throughout the level, players can increase their multiplier, allowing them to achieve higher scores. The ultimate goal of the game is to reach the end while collecting as many balloons as possible.


## Game Assets

The models used in the game were made by a modeler on my team. The sky box used was licensed and given to us by the organizers just for this game jam. The sound effects that were used in the game were taken from bensound.
