title: Flappy bird
---

I made a replica of the famous game flappy bird. This was for one of my university course final project where our goal was to make the bird jump without using unity's built-in physics. I acheived this by using newtons first equation of motion "v = u + at". 


## Game Assets

The spritesheet was taken online.
