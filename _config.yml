  Hello my name is Sohaib Awan and I work as a game developer based in Karachi, Pakistan. My passion for gaming has driven me to pursue this career, and I particularly enjoy playing games such as FIFA, the Call of Duty series, Gone Home, Stray, and Shank.Besides gaming, I also have a keen interest in football and am a big fan of Manchester United. In my leisure time, I enjoy watching horror movies and anime. I'm also involved in investing in NFTs as a side hustle.As a game developer, I believe that my love for gaming and knowledge of the industry puts me in a unique position to create exciting and immersive experiences for players. My experience working on various game projects has given me the skills to tackle challenging tasks and work collaboratively with a team.
