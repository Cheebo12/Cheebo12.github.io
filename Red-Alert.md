Red Alert is 3D platformer gave which was submitted for a game jam with the theme "Color matters". The game puts you in control of a ball and you must navigate through obstacles and reach the end of each level. As you progress, the levels become more challenging, requiring precise jumps and well-timed maneuvers to avoid hazards and reach the finish line.
